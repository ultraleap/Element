# LMNT Instructions

These are the possible valid instructions in LMNT and their meaning. Any arguments not mentioned in an instruction's definition or described as reserved are unused by that function and can be assumed to contain an indeterminate value.

**Note that these are currently subject to change at any time.**

## Value types
* **Scalar (S)**: a single value occupying one stack location
* **Vector (V)**: a 4-wide array of values occupying four contiguous stack locations
* **Immediate (I)**: a value encoded in the instruction, either as an integer (II) or a binary value (IB)
* **Reference (R)**: a single value occupying one stack location whose value (cast to integer) is another location, either on the stack or in another table

## Argument types
* **Stack Loc**: an integer representing a location on the function's stack
* **Immediate**: a value encoded into the argument itself
* **Stack Ref**: an integer location on the stack, the value contained in which (cast to integer) is the stack location to act upon
* **Data Ref**: an integer location on the stack, the value contained in which (cast to integer) is the index to act upon in a separately-specified data section
* **Def Pointer**: an integer offset into the archive's defs table, representing a function
* **Code Index**: an integer index into the current function's code entry, effectively pointing to an instruction

## Default assumptions
These assumptions apply to all instructions unless otherwise noted.
* **Safety**: in an archive which has passed validation, instructions cannot cause access violations or otherwise fail.
* **Halting**: the program can be assumed to halt in a predictable amount of time.
* **Dependencies**: instructions are not directly dependent on each other.
* **Aliasing**: input and output stack locations may be aliased. For vector operations, the aliasing must be aligned - i.e. the output location must be the same as the input location(s) or they must not overlap at all.
* **Rounding**: all rounding uses default IEEE754 behaviour.
* **NaNs**: any operation involving one or more NaNs will produce a result of NaN. For memberwise vector operations, other lanes of the operation must not be affected.

# Instruction Reference

## `NOOP`
Takes no action.

Implementations may choose to elide this operation when executing, but **must** respect its position in the function (e.g. when calculating branch targets).


## `RETURN`
Returns from the current function immediately.


## `ASSIGNSS`

    stack[arg3] = data[arg1][data_index]
```


## `DLOADIRV`
Reads a 4-wide vector of constants from the specified data section and index and writes them to four stack locations.

## `CMP`
Compares the two specified inputs, and stores the result in an internal set of flags.

The flags stored are:
* **`EQ` (equal)**: the first argument compares equal to the second argument
* **`LT` (less-than)**: the first argument compares less than the second argument
* **`GT` (greater-than)**: the first argument compares greater than the second argument
* **`UN` (unordered)**: the comparison is unordered (i.e. at least one argument was `NaN`)

**NaNs**: if one or both arguments are `NaN`, then `UN` will be set and no other flags will.

| 1   | Input     | Stack Loc  | Scalar | Location of the first input to compare  |
| 2   | Input     | Stack Loc  | Scalar | Location of the second input to compare |

```c
    flags.EQ = (stack[arg1] == stack[arg2])
    flags.LT = (stack[arg1] <  stack[arg2])
    flags.GT = (stack[arg1] >  stack[arg2])
    flags.UN = (isnan(stack[arg1]) || isnan(stack[arg2]))
```

## `BRANCHCEQ`
Branch to the target instruction if the last `CMP` instruction produced an equal-to result; the branch target is specified by its absolute index within the current function.

**Halting**: if a branch's target is not later than the branch instruction in the function, halting cannot be guaranteed and execution time cannot be easily predicted.

**Dependencies**: this instruction is only guaranteed to perform as expected if it is immediately preceded by a `CMP` instruction, or if the only intervening instructions are other `BRANCHCxx` instructions.

| 2   | Input     | Code Index | LO(UInt32) | Low half of the target instruction index  |
| 3   | Input     | Code Index | HI(UInt32) | High half of the target instruction index |

```c
    target = (arg2 | (arg3 << sizeof(arg2)))
    if (flags.EQ)
        goto instructions[target]
```


## `BRANCHCNE`
Branch to the target instruction if the last `CMP` instruction produced a not-equal result; the branch target is specified by its absolute index within the current function.

**Halting**: if a branch's target is not later than the branch instruction in the function, halting cannot be guaranteed and execution time cannot be easily predicted.

**Dependencies**: this instruction is only guaranteed to perform as expected if it is immediately preceded by a `CMP` instruction, or if the only intervening instructions are other `BRANCHCxx` instructions.

**NaNs**: if one or both of the prior comparison's arguments are `NaN`, the branch will be taken (since `EQ` will not be set)

## `BRANCHCLT`
Branch to the target instruction if the last `CMP` instruction produced a less-than result; the branch target is specified by its absolute index within the current function.

## `EXTCALL`
Calls out to a runtime-defined function, specified via an address into the archive's `defs` table. This allows specific runtimes to add functionality not normally available using LMNT, at the cost of non-portability.

Any archive containing an external def with a name and signature which does not match those known to the runtime will also fail to validate. This mechanism can also be disabled entirely at compile-time; in this instance, any archive containing any defs marked as external will fail to validate.

Summarily: this functionality is discouraged in most cases, but can allow for a wider range of functionality without otherwise compromising the guarantees of the system.

**Halting**: since this instruction calls out to platform-controlled code, there is no guarantee that said code will halt and thus the same is true of this instruction.

    rvals = stack + arg3 + def.args_count
    def.function(args, def.args_count, rvals, def.rvals_count)
